===========

minesweeper game + shoddily put together gui + a board solver


board.py + solver.py are examples of okay code


mines_pyglet.py on the other hand...
forgive me for i have sinned: i used globals to put together a rough gui, and i just kept adding to it instead of wrapping it up in a class. i know this is bad and wrong.
also lol at my use of pyglet.

gplv3 + stipulation that i get a high five or a 'kudos' on twitter.
